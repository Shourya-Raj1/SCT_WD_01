# SCT_WD_01


## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my **Web Developer Internship**. The goal was to create a modern, responsive landing page featuring a highly interactive navigation system. The project focuses on user experience (UX) by providing visual feedback through scroll-triggered events and hover effects.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Fixed Navigation:** The menu remains accessible at the top of the viewport regardless of scroll position.
* **Dynamic Scroll Styling:** Utilizing JavaScript to detect scroll depth and trigger CSS class changes (e.g., background color shift, shadow depth).
* **Interactive Hover Effects:** Smooth transitions on menu items to improve navigation clarity.
* **Fully Responsive:** A "mobile-first" approach ensures the layout adapts seamlessly to smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

## 📖 What I Learned

During this first task, I focused on:

1. **DOM Manipulation:** Learning how to listen for `window.onscroll` events to change element styles dynamically.
2. **CSS Transitions:** Mastering smooth animations rather than abrupt color changes.
3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensuring the "fixed" position and hover states work across different browsers.
